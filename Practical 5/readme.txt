/////////////////// SUBNET CALCULATOR /////////////////////

This program was engineered and developed by Rocco Castoro

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


This is a free fully functioning subnet calculator I created for easy determination of subnet details needed when in any IT college class or IT related networking position. It's accurate and functional, so please feel free to use it.

The code is a bit disorganized because I'm rather new to C++ still, but the program works great - and it's useful.
