Hamming Code:

If m = 1010, determine the sender site and verify the receiver site codeword using hamming method for even parity.

Codewaord = Databits + parity

Steps to solve the problem:

1. Decide the no. of bits in the codeword
2. Decide which parity bit checks which position and calculate the values for parity bits.
